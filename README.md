  - Lesson 4.4: Complete webpage with reasonable layout

### JavaScript
- Lab 5
  - Lesson 5.1: Introduction to internal JavaScript and debugging methods such as `document.write`, `document.writeln`, and `consol.log`.
  - Lesson 5.2: Defining variables, undefined values, unary operator, automatic type conversion
  - Lesson 5.3: Arithmetic operation
  - Lesson 5.4: `if-else-statement`, short `if-statement`, `switch`
  - Lesson 5.5: loops, breaking out of loop
  - Lesson 5.6: popup windows (`alert`, `prompt`, and `confirm`)
  - Lesson 5.7: Defining a `function`, parameters and scopes
- Lab 6
  - Lesson 6.1: Data Structure: Array, Stack, and update core language using prototype (example used here: implementing Queue by defining new method dequeue within Array class).
  - Lesson 6.2: OOP, Defining basic object, class, and class inheritance.

  - JavaScript useful usages examples: (lab instructor could show students the possibility of JavaScript which help them to invent new project ideas from these examples)
    - **AddressBook**: Object-Oriented programming that include form validator, regular expression, manage database (browser localStorage) and much more.
    - **DrawApp**: Also OOP application provides drawing tools to draw line, circle, rectangle, and square.
    - **Game**: an interactive game that records points detect when user complete basic level. Students could learn from this example how to interact with keyboard.
    - **Painter**: a complete application similar to Windows Paint application done in less than 190 lines using JavaScript and HTML5 canvas only to draw several shapes with different setting and colors.
